\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:Discussion}
After completing the experiments it was found that the values selected for
the missing resistors in the voltage divider in the first part generated successful results.
Once formed into a table it could be seen that the resistor that was supposed to draw 20\% of the power
used 22\%, the resistor that was supposed to draw 30\% used 31\%, and finally,
the resistor that was supposed to use 50\% used 46\%. The last resistor was
only the closest one in stock to the value. The calculated value was $2.5 k\Omega$
and the value used was $2.2 k\Omega$. This would account for the difference in results.
It was found that this circuit did obey conservation of electric power and Kirchhoff's voltage rule.

Additionally, it was found that the values selected for
the missing resistors in the second part generated successful results.
Once formed into a table it could be seen that the resistor that was supposed to draw 20\% of the power
used 20\%, the resistor that was supposed to draw 30\% used 32\%, and finally,
the resistor that was supposed to use 50\% used 47\%. The source of error in these values
is most likely because the provided resistor values that were not consistent with
the calculated values. The closest resistors in value were selected. From the results, it was
apparent that that the circuit did obey conservation of electric power and Kirchhoff's current rule.

Finally, the value that was selected for the wheatstone bridge appeared to generated the
expected result. The voltage measured was nearly zero, which is characteristic of
a wheatstone bridge when the values are matched.

\section{Conclusion and Recommendations}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
This experiment was a valuable introduction to Digilent Analog Discovery board
and served its purpose to become familiar with the platform. It was surprising to
see the measured results come so close to the calculated results despite limitations
in resistor selection. This lab was an improvement on the last as far as organization
which should continue into future labs. This lab was helpful and will provide a
foundation in the following labs that build off of these experiments.
